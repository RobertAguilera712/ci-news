comparatives use

* We use the comparative form to show the difference between two people or things.
Basketball is livelier than baseball. 
Soccer is more popular than boxing.
* We use than before the second item of comparison.
European children train more rigorously in soccer than American children.
* We can use less to make a comparison.
Soccer is less popular than football in the U.S.
* We can put more, less, fewer, better, worse, and other comparative forms before a noun.
College athletes have less experience than professional athletes.
* We use less with non count nouns; we use fewer with count nouns.
Soccer players have fewer injuries than football players.
* We can put more, less, better, worse, and other comparative forms after a verb (phrase)
My sister likes soccer more than I do.
You play basketball better than your brother does.
* Much, a lot, or a little can come before a comparative form.
Interest in soccer is much lower in the U.S. than it is in other countries.
I like soccer a little better than I like baseball.
* We can use two comparisons in one sentence to show cause and result.
The more they practice, the better they play.
The older you are, the harder it is to learn a new sport.

Notes
1. Omit than if the second item of comparison is not included.
Basketball is popular in the U.S., but football is more popular.
2. When a pronoun follows than, the correct form is the subject pronoun (he,
she, I, etc.). Usually an auxiliary verb follows (is, do, did, can, etc.).
Informally, many Americans use the object pronoun (him, her, me, etc.) after
than without an auxiliary verb.

Formal: You are taller than I am. Formal: I can play soccer better than he can.
InFormal: You are taller than me. InFormal: I can play soccer better than him.
